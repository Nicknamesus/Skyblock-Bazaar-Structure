# Skyblock-Bazaar-Structure
This is repository contains a json file with the structure of the skyblock bazaar. It can be used for other projects and helps structure the API.

## General info
This repository contains all item IDs mentioned in [the official Skyblock Bazaar Wiki](https://wiki.hypixel.net/Bazaar). It represents how the Bazaar is structured in-game, each item id being an official skyblock item id (unless there was an error in the Wiki that i didn't notice.

## How to use
Each item has a craft. It can either be 'base', meaning its not craftable, or a dictionary. The dictionnary contains the ID of each item needed for the craft and how much of it is needed. 

Beware, the items are listed even if they can't be bought via bazzar, items made via forge or other ways to combine items to make items into another item are also considered craftable and coins used it alternative crafting methods are also considered an item!

'craft2' is an alternative way to craft the item, and 'amount_made' tells how much of that item the alternative craft produces.
